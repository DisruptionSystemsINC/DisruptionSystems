speacial furnace for hydermanium (thermite_furnace)
Lithium Ore Spawn (bigger quantities than hydermanium)

v considering

R.E.A.C.T.O.R. building block
replicator multiblock (capable of teleporting players to Hydrus [maybe after they get there by a rocker or sum idk])
hydrus dimension (red sand deserted planet, sharp mountains/hills, ravines, higher hydermanium spawn count, new type of stone)
------------------------
v ideas
------------------------
Hydranium drill-bit
Hydrogen powered drill
Electrolyser (or a hydrogen pump)
Electricity powered drill (less expensive but less efficient than hydrogen drill)
Hydermanium cell powered drill (most efficient yet most expensive)
Hydermanium finder
Hydranium drill-bit (more durability than the hydermanium one)
Lithium cells
Hydrogen cells (or "Hydrogen tanks", maybe both just different capacities and uses)
Portable hydrogen powered generator/recharger (1x1 block, uses hydrogen to create electricity)
Hydermanium powered rifles (just like in rp uwu)
Disruption shield module (powered by hydermanium cells, can be upgraded for better efficiency/durability, module for a chestplate)

Hydermanium wires
PERSONAL PORTABLE MATTER ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM ACCESS POINT(PPMESS)-(basically a portable ender chest, nobody else than the owner can use it tho, needs little power, compatible with replicators)
Terminal door locks (uses a 4 digit code, function as buttons and/or levers, menu with the options "button" or "lever")
Advanced Terminal door lock (doesn't use a code, uses the ID wristband and/or player ID, wristband is for other players than the owner of the lock, function as buttons and/or levers, menu with the options "button" or "lever")
Shielded door (normal functioning door, higher blast resistace)
Heavy shielded door (uses hydermanium plates as shielding, needs redstone signal to be opened, high blast resistance)
ID wristband (used for the Adv. terminal door lock)
Steel arrow Cartrige (1 steel, 1 gunpowder, 7 arrows) (used with the hydermanium stiffened bow)
